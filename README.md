# Language-Translation-using-Hand-Gesture
The Language Translation using Hand Gesture project focuses on developing a system that translates hand gestures into programming language. This involves capturing gestures through cameras or sensors, which are then processed using machine learning models to recognize and interpret the meaning of each gesture.
